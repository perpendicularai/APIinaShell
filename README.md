# APIinaShell

An API deployed using fastapi running LlamaCpp as the backend to do LLM inference. The purpose of the script is to abstract the complexity of deploying a LlamaCpp API instance on a global scale.

## Dependencies
- llama_cpp_python
- fastapi
- requests
- uvicorn

Install with `pip`.

## How to üó∫Ô∏è
To start using the api, you need to ensure that LlamaCpp is installed.
- In a command prompt, run `uvicorn apiinashell:app --reload --host <ip address> --port <port number>`.
This should start the api server at the configured address.
- Open a browser and browse to the address displayed in the command prompt by appending üì∞ /docs. You should see the :dependabot: api interface.
- You can then enter a string to test it out. See video :
